| ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Apache HTTP Server | Apache License 2.0 | [Apache](https://apache.org)     |
| Nginx              | BSD-like license   | [Nginx](https://nginx.org)       |
| Microsoft IIS      | Proprietary        | [Microsoft IIS](https://iis.net) |

## Other Relevant Concepts
* **Systemd**
Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems that uses a daemon to manage and maintain system states.

* **Systemctl**
Systemctl is a command-line utility that allows users to analyze and control the state of the "systemd" system and service manager.

* **Virtual hosts**
Virtual hosts allow a single web server to serve multiple websites or domains. This is a crucial feature in Apache and other web servers.

* **Log file**
Log files in a web server environment are files that record activities. These logs are vital for troubleshooting and understanding traffic data.
